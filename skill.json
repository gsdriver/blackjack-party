You and up to 3 friends can play against the dealer at the same table, optionally using Echo Buttons to keep track of each player's turn.

Improve your blackjack skills by asking for a suggestion on any hand (\"what should I do\") or use training mode (\"enter training mode\"), where Alexa will prompt you with the recommended play on every hand!  This full-featured game has it all - hit, stand, split, double down, and even surrender.\n\nCompare your peak bankroll with other players by saying \"read high scores\" to hear the leader board for all players on your device.\n\nHave feedback or features you'd like to see?
